This library makes it easier to get the readings from two MPUs at once.

1- First make an MPU object:
Ex:
MPU mpu1(1); // 1 for 0x68 address
MPU mpu2(2); // 2 for 0x69 address
    
2- Setup the mpu in the "void setup()":
Ex:
mpu1.setup();

3- calculate the angles in the "void loop()":
Ex: calculateAngles();

4- get the desired angle:
note: the datatype is double
EX:
mpu1.getX(); //for x angle
mpu1.getY(); //for y angle
mpu1.getZ(); //for z angle

//you can get the readings from the other object as well
